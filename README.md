# Hexagonal-Puzzle
A hexagonal mixup puzzle game coded in python for a class project at Drexel University

Thanks for checking out our project! This is a self designed puzzle game, developed in Python with a team of 5 students. Using self selected images, and mathematics we created a puzzle game that mixes up its own hexagonal tiles for the user to then reorder them and solve the puzzle. Python concepts we used include: stacks, randomizing and self made functions, and conditional statements and loops.
