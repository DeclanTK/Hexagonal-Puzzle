# Hexagonal-Puzzle
A hexagonal mixup-solve puzzle game coded in python for a sophomore class project at Drexel University.

Thanks for checking out our project! This is a self designed puzzle game, developed in Python with a team of 5 students. Using self selected images, and mathematics we created a puzzle game that mixes up its own hexagonal tiles for the user to then reorder and solve the puzzle. Python concepts we used include: stacks, randomizing and self made functions, and conditional statements and loops.

You'll find all of the image files, as well as all python files are included in this repository. All files must be downloaded in order for the game to function correctly and completely.

In order to start the game correctly you should run the file "Hexagonal_Image_Puzzle.py" first, this should be the only file you need to manually run. The first (and only) GUI you will encounter will be the game screen, from here you can choose an image, a difficulty level, and start a game. The ideal steps to take would be to click the drop down menu to choose an image, then do the same to choose a difficulty, then click the "START" button to begin the game. You cannot click the "SOLVE" or "RESET" buttons until you've begun a new game. Once a game is started, you can play until you win or click "SOLVE" to solve the game (in order to see the completed image) and start a new game, or "RESET" to clear the screen and start a new game.

It is relatively simply to play and use however the mathematics behind it as well as the code took a fair amount of work. In any case I hope you enjoy!
